<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Quite new Opera, <i>Faust</i>. Some people say they've heard it
before. Others add, "Yes, and more than once this season." Unwritten
law in <i>Codex Druriolanum</i> is "You can't have too much of a good
thing." There are a hundred different ways of dressing chicken; so
with <i>Faust</i>. This time <i>Faust</i> comes and is <i>Faust</i> served with
<i>Sauce Marguerite à l'Emma Eames</i>. Uncommonly good. <i>Faust lui-même à
l'Alvarez</i> goes down uncommonly well. <i>Mefisto-Plançon Sauce au bon
diable</i>, a little overdone, perhaps, but decidedly a popular dish.
Baton of <span class="sc">Bevignani</span> keeps all the ingredients well stirred up.
House full.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<i>Carmen.</i> Madame <span class="sc">Bellincioni</span> and Signor
<span class="sc">Ancona</span> going strong. Capital house, spite of shadow of
dissolution being over us all.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<i>Nozze di Figaro</i>, with <span class="sc">Emma Eames</span> as Countess,
singing charmingly, and looking like portrait of Court Beauty by Sir
<span class="sc">Peter Lely</span>. <i>Maurel-Almaviva</i> all right for voice, but not up
to his Countess in aristocratic appearance. However, this is in keeping
with character of nobleman whose most intimate friend is his barber,
and who makes love to the barber's <i>fiancée</i>, who is also his wife's
<i>femme de chambre</i>.</p>

<p class="center">ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</p>

<p>At the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Sports on Wednesday last, great
surprise was expressed at the defeat of the hitherto invincible Mr.
<span class="sc">C. B. Fry</span> by Mr. <span class="sc">Mendelson</span> in the Long Jump. Mr.
<span class="sc">Mendelson</span>, who comes to us from New Zealand, has not only done
a fine performance, but he has also jumped into fame. It is at any rate
obvious that it is quite impossible for him to represent his University
in the High Jump, for</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a musical name (though he varies the spelling),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This youth from New Zealand is bound to go far.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He couldn't jump high, since (it's truth I am telling)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No master of music e'er misses a bar.</span><br />
</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Long Jump, snatched like a brand from the burning, practically gave
the victory in the whole contest to Cambridge, who also won the Weight,
the Mile, the Three Miles and the Quarter.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Light Blues triumphed, fortune being shifty;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They cheered <span class="sc">FitzHerbert</span> sprinting home in fifty.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For strength the weight-man's parents have a hot son,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Witness the put of youthful Mr. <span class="sc">Watson</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="sc">Lutyens</span>, who always pleases as he goes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Romped in, his glasses poised upon his nose.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And none that day with greater dash and go ran</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than the Light Blue three-miler, Mr. <span class="sc">Horan</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>During the practice of the crews for Henley Regatta there has been one
exalted contest, which I cannot remember hearing of in former years.
My <i>Sporting Life</i> (of which I am a diligent and a constant reader)
informed me that "at one time it did seem as though Jupiter Pluvius was
about to swamp Old Boreas, but the latter proved too tough." Quite a
sporting event, evidently. Why, oh why, was not Old Boreas present when
Pelion was piled upon Ossa? The whole course of (pre) history might
have been changed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Newcastle contemporary has been discussing the art of adding to
the beauty of women by the use of cosmetics, &amp;c. May I commend the
following extract to the notice of the ladies of England?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No woman is capable of being beautiful who is capable of being false.
The true art of assisting beauty consists in embellishing the whole
person by the ornaments of virtuous and commendable qualities. How
much nobler is the contemplation of beauty when it is heightened
by virtue! How faint and spiritless are the charms of a coquette,
when compared with the loveliness of innocence, piety, good-humour,
and truth&mdash;virtues which add a new softness to their sex, and even
beautify their beauty! That agreeableness possessed by the modest
virgin is now preserved in the tender mother, the prudent friend, and
the faithful wife. Colours artfully spread upon canvas may entertain
the eye, but not touch the heart; and she who takes no care to add
to the natural graces of her person, noble qualities, may amuse as a
picture, but not triumph as a beauty."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Cheltenham is a pleasant place. I quote from a memory which is, I know,
miserably defective:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Year by year do England's daughters</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the fairest gloves and shawls</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Troop to drink the Cheltenham waters,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And adorn the Cheltenham balls.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is not the place that one would naturally associate with violent
language over so small a matter as the rejection of some plans. A
quarrel, however, has taken place in the Town Council, and terrible
words have been spoken:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the course of a discussion on the rejection of some plans, Mr.
<span class="sc">Margrett</span> accused the acting chairman of the Streets Committee
(Mr. <span class="sc">Parsonage</span>) with being influenced by personal and
political motives against the person (Mr. <span class="sc">Barnfield</span>) who
sent them in. Mr. <span class="sc">Parsonage</span> warmly retorted with the lie
direct, and told Mr. <span class="sc">Margrett</span> that he knew he was lying. Mr.
<span class="sc">Lenthall</span> accused Mr. <span class="sc">Parsonage</span> of being 'slip-shod'
in his method of bringing up the minutes of the Streets Committee,
because he had passed over without comment a dispute between the
Corporation and the Board of Guardians. While denying this imputation,
Mr. <span class="sc">Parsonage</span> said he would even prefer to be 'slip-shod'
than to follow Mr. <span class="sc">Lenthall's</span> example of giving utterance to
a long-winded and frothy oration over such a trumpery matter as a road
fence."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this I quite expected to read that some one&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">... raised a point of order, when</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he smiled a sort of sickly smile and curled upon the floor!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But the matter seems to have dropped, and everything to have ended
peacefully&mdash;a great and bitter disappointment to all lovers of ructions.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Even in aquatic matters Ireland is a country of surprises. In the
Eight-oared race the other day for the "Pembroke Cup," there was a
dead-heat between the Shandon Boat Club and the Dublin University
Boat Club. In the row-off, the <i>Irish Independent</i> says that "Boat
Club caught the water first, but after a few strokes Shandon forged
in front. After the mile mark, Shandon were rowing eighteen against
the Boat Club's nineteen or twenty. In the next three hundred yards
Boat Club dropped to seventeen, the others being steady at nineteen
all through. About one hundred and fifty yards off the fishery step
the Boat Club quickened up to forty and got within two feet of their
opponents. Then, amid the greatest excitement, Boat Club got in front
and won by a canvas." A stroke oar who can row a race at nineteen to
the minute all through is steadier but certainly less versatile than
one who can spring suddenly from the rate of seventeen to the rate
of forty. As admirable as either is the genius of the reporter who
describes the event.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">H. M. Hyndman</span> is the Socialist candidate for Burnley. He
advocates "the immediate nationalisation and socialisation of railways,
mines, factories, and the land, with a view to establishing organised
co-operation for production and distribution in every department under
the control of the entire community. There should be a minimum wage
of thirty shillings a week in all State and Municipal employment, as
well as in State-created monopolies." There's a modest and practical
programme for you! But this windy gentleman's opponents may reply
that they prefer the system of each for himself, and d&mdash;&mdash;l take the
<span class="sc">Hyndman</span>, to all the verbiage of the Socialist froth-pot.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Many reasons have been given for the fall of the late Government. It
has been left to a correspondent of the <i>Birmingham Daily Post</i> to
discover the real and only one. "It is most unfair," he says, "to hold
them entirely responsible for all the shortcomings, blunders, and
failures which distorted their administration. How could they help
these things? Has it never occurred to you that the Government of Lord
<span class="sc">Rosebery</span> was the '13th' Parliament of Queen <span class="sc">Victoria</span>?
Can anybody reasonably expect good government from a 13th Parliament?
It is out of all question." What <i>persiflage</i>, what wit!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I sorrow over the new town clock of Dalkey. In my <i>Freeman's Journal</i> I
read that, at the monthly meeting of the Dalkey Township Commissioners,
a letter was read from Messrs. <span class="sc">Chancellor and Sons</span>, stating
that the new town clock could not be made to strike, but they could
make a new clock for £100. The letter was marked read&mdash;and no wonder.
If it can't strike, it had better be wound up, and Dalkey is obviously
the place to wind it. Otherwise there seems no reason in the Township's
name.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Clevedon is, I believe, in Somerset. Anyone in search of a sensation
ought to have gone there last week, for it is stated that "Mr.
<span class="sc">Victor Rosini's</span> Spectral Opera Company commenced a week's
engagement at the Public Hall on Monday evening." I cannot imagine
a spectral <i>basso</i> or <i>tenore robusto</i>. And in any case, why should
the unfortunate operatic spectres be harried into giving public
performances?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Musical Honours!!</span>&mdash;The friends of Sir <span class="sc">Henry James, Q.C.,
M.P.</span>, will celebrate his being raised to the peerage by serenading
with "<i>The Aylestone Chorus</i>."</p>

<p class="ph3">HER PREVIOUS SWEETHEART.</p>


<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Violet has accepted me, this very day, the happiest of
my life. She is the sweetest and prettiest woman in the world. I have
loved her long and passionately. She has not loved me long, and she
could never love me passionately. She is rather unemotional. Even when
I kissed her this afternoon for the first time she was quite calm. She
tells me she has once loved, as though she could never love again. Her
previous sweetheart was a Captain. I am a mere writer. His name was
<span class="sc">Percy Plantagenet Cholmondeley</span>. Mine is <span class="sc">Jones</span>. I hope
that in time she may forget him.</p>


<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Meet her in the Row, and sit under the trees. She is fond
of horses. So am I, but I do not ride often. She mentions that Captain
<span class="sc">Cholmondeley</span> was a splendid rider. Listen patiently to what
she tells me.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;To the Opera with <span class="sc">Violet</span> and her people. She
does not care for <span class="sc">Gounod's</span> <i>Faust</i>. Prefers a burlesque
with comic songs. Says the Captain sang comic songs admirably, with
banjo accompaniment. When it's well done, I also like that. Tell
her so. This encourages her to further reminiscences. Of course,
she is right to conceal nothing from me now we are engaged, but
frankness, even engaging frankness, may be carried too far. Manage
to change the subject at last, and then unfortunately the Soldier's
Chorus reminds her of a parody in an amateur burlesque which Captain
<span class="sc">Cholmondeley</span>&mdash;&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Meet her at Hurlingham. She is so fond of polo. She says
the Captain was a splendid player. I expected that. A sort of Champion
of the World. Of course. I never played in my life. Listen to an
account of his exploits. Rather bored.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Up the river. Very hot day. Delightful to lounge in the
shade and smoke. <span class="sc">Violet</span> more energetic. Compels me to exert
myself. She says the Captain could do anything in a boat. No doubt. I
am prepared to hear that he shot the Falls of Niagara in a punt. He was
a wonderful genius. I am tired of hearing of him.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;To Mr. <span class="sc">Montgomery-Mumby's</span> dance. <span class="sc">Violet</span>
there of course. We both like dancing. Get on charmingly together.
Suddenly something reminds her of the ever-lamented Captain P. P. C.
I suggest that he has said good-bye to her for ever, as his initials
show. She does not see the little joke. Have to explain it to her. Then
she says it is a very poor joke. No doubt it is, but she needn't tell
me so. Annoying. A certain coolness between us.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;To the French play with <span class="sc">Violet</span> and her aunt.
She understands French very well. Seems to think a lot of me
because I know something of several languages. Ask her if Captain
<span class="sc">Cholmondeley</span> was fond of learning languages. Am prepared to
hear that he was a second <span class="sc">Mezzofanti</span>. On the contrary, it
seems that he couldn't speak a word of anything but English, and that
he didn't speak very much that was worth hearing even in that. The only
French he could understand was in a <i>menu</i>. Apparently he never read
anything else in any language, except the sporting papers in English.
Have at last found something he could not do. Delighted. Unfortunately
show this. <span class="sc">Violet</span> begins to defend him. I say he must have
been rather a duffer. She retorts that I can't play polo. What has that
to do with it? Again a coolness between us.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;It is all over! We have parted for ever. She could never
forget that confounded Captain. Asked her this morning, when she was
telling me of his shooting elephants, or alligators, or rabbits, or
sparrows, or something wonderful, why she did not marry him. She says
it was broken off. She shows me his last letter of farewell. I read
it critically. It is very short. Point out to her nine mistakes in
spelling, and four in grammar. She says I am brutal. Indignation.
Argument. Scorn. Tears. Farewell.</p>

<span class="sc">Robbie</span>, my man, I'm thinking your mither wouldna' just
approve o' my takkin' ye to sic a perfairmance as yon Burrmese
dancing-women.... Nay, nay, laddie, there's deceitfulness eneugh in
the naitural man withoot needing to lairn ony mair o't fro' these
puir juggling Indian bodies wi' their snake-chairmin' an' sic godless
doins!... Ride on the elephant? Havers! Ye can do that fine in the
Zooloagical Gairdens.... 'Twould be just sinful extrawvagance in me to
be throwing away guid siller wi' so mony bonny sichts to be seen for
naething.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gourmay</i> (<i>who is dying for his dinner, to his pretty cousins, who
cannot be got past the Indian craftsmen</i>). Yes, yes, very interesting,
and all that; but we can see it just as well if we come back <i>later</i>,
you know.</p>

<p><i>His Cousin Belle.</i> But they may have stopped by then. I <i>must</i> just
see him finish the pattern; it's too <i>fascinating!</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Gourm.</i> I&mdash;er&mdash;don't want to <i>hurry</i> you, you know, only, you see,
if we don't look sharp, we shan't be in time to secure an outside table
at the Restaurant. Much jollier dining in the open air.</p>

<p><i>His Cousin Imogen.</i> Oh, it's too hot to <i>think</i> of food. I'm not in
the <i>least</i> hungry&mdash;are <i>you</i>, Belle?</p>

<p><i>Belle.</i> No; I'd ever so much rather see the Burmese dancers and the
Indian conjurors. I don't want to waste the best part of the evening
over dinner; we might have some of that nice Indian tea and a piece of
cake by-and-by, perhaps, if there's time.</p>

<p><i>Energetic Leader</i> (<i>to his party, who are faint, but pursuing</i>). No,
there's nothing particular to see here. I tell you what <i>my</i> plan is.
We'll go and do the Kinetoscopes and the Phonographs, have a look at
the Great Wheel, and some shots at the Rifle Range, cross over and
take a turn on the Switchback, finish up with a cold-meat supper at
<span class="sc">Spiers and Pond's</span>, and a stroll round the band-stand, and, by
the time we've done, we shall have got a very fair idea of what India's

<p><i>Second Relative.</i> She would have it none of 'em looked strong enough
for her. And what <i>do</i> you think she goes and does next? Tries to
bargain with a black man to take her for a turn on one o' them little
bullock-carts! I really hadn't the patience to stop and see what come
of it.</p>

<p><i>Miss Rashleigh</i> (<i>by the Burmese Cheroot Stall, audibly, to her
companion</i>). Just look at this girl, my dear, with a great cigar in
her mouth! Fancy their being New Women in Burmah! And such a <i>hideous</i>
creature, too!</p>

<p><i>Her Companion.</i> Take care, my dear, she'll hear you. I expect she
understands English.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Moul.</i> It's beautiful. 'Ow ever they can <i>do</i> it all! (<i>After a

<p><i>Mr. Moul.</i> A animal! where? Ah, I can make out somethink now. (<i>With

<p class="ph3">ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.</p>

<p><i>Brybury-on-the-Pocket.</i>&mdash;Both candidates very busy. Meetings are
being held all day long at the principal hotels, and any number of
livery-stable-keepers have promised to lend their carriages on the
day of election. The agents on either side have an enormous staff of
assistants, and trade was never known to be brisker during the present
century.</p>

<p><i>Crowncrushington.</i>&mdash;This will be a very near contest. As political
feeling runs rather high, a number of extra beds have been prepared in
the hospitals. The police have been reinforced, and the military are
close at hand, and every other preparation has been made to secure the
declaration of the poll with as little friction as possible.</p>

<p><i>Meddle-cum-Muddleborough.</i>&mdash;At present there are seven candidates,
but as three of these have issued their manifestoes under some
misapprehension it is not unlikely that the number will be reduced
before the day of nomination. It is not easy to foretell the result, as
since the establishment of the ballot every election has ended not only
in surprise but stupefaction.</p>

<p><i>Selfseekington.</i>&mdash;It is not unlikely that there will be no contest
in this important borough. The (until recently) sitting member has
fixed the day that would naturally have fallen to the function of the
returning officer for the laying of the foundation stones of his Baths,
Wash-houses, Free Library and Town Hall, and the opening of his Public
Park.</p>

<p><i>Wrottenborough.</i>&mdash;The popular candidate has pledged himself to
supporting Local Veto, the Licensed Victuallers, Establishment,
Disestablishment, Home Rule, the Integrity of the Empire,
Anti-Vaccination, the Freedom of the Medical Profession, and many other
matters of conflicting importance. The polling will be of a perfunctory
character, as expenses are being cut down on both sides.</p>

<p><i>Zany-town-on-the-Snooze.</i>&mdash;There will be no contest in this division.
At present there is no intelligence of any sort to chronicle.</p>

</div>
<p>Ere these lines can appear, the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> and their
two Ladies will have vanished from Daly's Theatre like the baseless
fabric of a dream, leaving, however, a very pleasant recollection of
the play in the minds of all who saw it&mdash;and a great many did, for
<span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span> <i>Two Gents</i> is a dramatic curiosity. Prettily
put on the stage as it was, with good music, picturesque costumes
and clever acting, it will dwell in our memories as an exceptionally
attractive revival.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">George Clarke</span>, the "stern parient," appeared as something
between a Doge and a Duke, and equally good as either, you bet; that
is, "'lowing," as <i>Uncle Remus</i> has it, that either Doge or Duke
has passed the greater part of his life in the United States. Mr.
<span class="sc">Frank Worthing</span> (nice seasidey name on a hot night in town)
a gentlemanly-villainous <i>Proteus</i>, and Mr. <span class="sc">John Craig</span> an
equally gentlemanly-virtuous <i>Valentine</i>. So "Gents both" are disposed
of. Mr. <i>James Lewis</i>, as <i>Launce</i>, playing "the lead" to his dog, put
into the part new humour in place of the old which has evaporated by
fluxion of time. <i>Launce's</i> sly dog, very original; part considerably
curtailed.</p>





<p>I see that a descendant of <span class="sc">Tyrone Power</span> appears as "Mine
Host." I did not gather from his costume that he was "a host in
himself," but thought he was a Venetian Judge or retired Doge; the
latter surmise receiving some confirmation from the fact that, while
the singing was going on, he, being somnolent, "doge'd" (as <i>Mrs.
Gamp</i> would say) in his chair. Sleeping or waking his was a dignified
performance. Miss <span class="sc">Elliot</span> a graceful <i>Sylvia</i>, who, as a
Milanese brunette, is artistically contrasted with Miss <span class="sc">Ada
Rehan</span>, of Florentine fairness, as <i>Julia</i>. All that is wanting
to this sketchy character Miss <span class="sc">Rehan</span> fills in, and makes the
design a finished picture. Improbable that <i>Proteus</i> should never
recognize <i>Julia</i> when disguised as a boy until she herself reveals her
identity. However, it was a very early work of <span class="sc">William's</span>: mere
child's play.</p>

<p>The most Clement of critics, our learned and ever amiable Scotus of
the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, speaking with authority from his column last
Saturday, recalls to us how many English actors and actresses have
successfully played in French on the Parisian stage, and adds to the
list the name of <span class="sc">Marie Halton</span>, who, excellent both in singing
and acting as <i>La Cigale</i> at the Lyric, will soon appear at a new
theatre in Paris, where she is to "create" French <i>rôles</i>&mdash;which,
Mlle. <span class="sc">Marie</span>, is a very pleasant way of making your bread. But
if we have in this actress an English <i>Chaumont</i>, why does not some
such astute manager as Mr. <span class="sc">Edwardes</span>, the Universal Theatre
Provider, induce <span class="sc">Halton</span> to Stay on&mdash;here, not only for her own
"benefit," but for that of the Light Opera-loving public.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith, Elder &amp; Co.</span> are carrying out a happy thought in
projecting what they call the Novel Series, a title which is the least
felicitous part of the business. It is designed to meet the views of
those who desire to possess, not to borrow (or indeed to steal) good
books. The volumes will not be too large to be carried in the pocket,
nor too small to lie on the shelf. Neatly bound, admirably printed,
they are to cost from two shillings up to four shillings, presumably
according to length and the inclusion of illustrations. The series
leads off with <i>The Story of Bessie Costrell</i>, by Mrs. <span class="sc">Humphry
Ward</span>. The story, if not precisely pleasant, is decidedly powerful.
Once taken up, there is uncontrollable disposition to read on to the
end, a yearning the size of the volume makes it possible conveniently
to satisfy. The new series starts with a promise announcements of
succeeding contributions seem likely to fulfil.</p>

not the mere fact that he bears a name honoured and revered in every

Such a miscellaneous collection of seedy hats, I think, could not be

<p>The writer ought to have signed himself "<span class="sc">Macbeth</span>;" the
"unguarded <span class="sc">Duncan</span>," whoever he may be, must be on his guard,
or passengers will strike for better hats. All bus-drivers and
conductors should wear silk hats, to typify the habitual softness of
their address. Why not put them into livery at once? The company that
did that would probably attract no end of custom. No revolution like
it, since the abolition of the box-seat! Uniform charges and uniformed
conductors should be the future rule of the road.</p>

<p class="ph3">BRIGGS, OF BALLIOL.</p>

<p class="ph4"><span class="sc">Part I.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Briggs</span> was the gayest dog in Balliol. If there was a bonfire
in the quad, and if the dons found their favourite chairs smouldering
in the ashes, <span class="sc">Briggs</span> was at the bottom of it. If the bulldogs
were led a five-mile chase at one o'clock in the morning, the gownless
figure that lured them on was <span class="sc">Briggs</span>. If the supper at
<span class="sc">Vinnie's</span> became so uproarious that the Proctor thought it
necessary to interfere, the gentleman that dropped him from the
first-floor window was <span class="sc">Briggs</span>. Anyone else would have been
sent down over and over again, but&mdash;<span class="sc">Briggs</span> stroked the Balliol
boat: <span class="sc">Briggs</span> had his cricket blue; <span class="sc">Briggs</span> was a dead
certainty against Cambridge for the quarter and the hundred: in short,
<span class="sc">Briggs</span> was indispensable to the College and the 'Varsity, and
therefore he was allowed to stay.</p>

<p>But what is this? A change has come over <span class="sc">Briggs</span>. He is another
man. Can it be&mdash;&mdash;? Impossible&mdash;and yet? Yes, it began that very
night. Everyone has heard of Miss <span class="sc">O'Gress</span>, the Pioneer. She
came up to Oxford to lecture; her subject was "Man: his Position and
<i>Raison d'être</i>." <span class="sc">Briggs</span> and I went to hear; went in light
laughing mood with little fear of any consequences. We listened to
the <span class="sc">O'Gress</span>. "There is no doubt," she said, "that Man was
intended by Nature to be the Father. For this high calling he should
endeavour to fit himself by every means in his power. He should
cultivate his body so as to render himself attractive to Woman. He
should be tall,"&mdash;her eye fell on <span class="sc">Briggs</span>&mdash;"he should be
handsome,"&mdash;still on <span class="sc">Briggs</span>&mdash;"he should be graceful, he
should be athletic."&mdash;At this point her eye seemed fairly to feast on
<span class="sc">Briggs</span>, and a curious lurid light lowered in it. She paused a
moment. I was sitting next to <span class="sc">Briggs</span>, and I felt a shiver run
through him. I looked at his face, and it was ghastly pale. I asked him
in a whisper if he felt faint? He impatiently motioned me to be silent,
and remained, as I thought, like a bird paralysed beneath the gaze of a
serpent. I heard no more, so anxious was I on my friend's account; nor
could I breathe with any freedom until the audience rose and we were
once again in the fresh air.</p>

<p>The following day there was a garden-party at Trinity. <span class="sc">Briggs</span>
said he was playing for the 'Varsity against Lancashire, and therefore
could not go. Imagine my surprise then, when, as I was doing the polite
among the strawberries and cream, I caught sight of him slinking down
the lime grove at the heels of the <span class="sc">O'Gress</span>. I rubbed my eyes
and looked again. Yes, it was <span class="sc">Briggs</span> indeed. The face was his;
the features were his; the figure was his; the clothes were his&mdash;but,
the buoyant step? the merry laugh? where, where, eh! where were they?</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>


<p>The Long Vac. passed, and we were all up again for Michaelmas Term.
There was a blank in our circle. "Where's <span class="sc">Briggs</span>?" asked
<span class="sc">Brown</span>. "Where's <span class="sc">Briggs</span>?" asked <span class="sc">Trotter</span> of
Trinity. We looked at one another. What! Nobody seen <span class="sc">Briggs</span>?
Not up yet?&mdash;Better go and see. We went to his rooms. No
<span class="sc">Briggs</span> there, and not a sign of his coming. We went to
<span class="sc">Jones</span>. <span class="sc">Jones</span> knew no more than we; to <span class="sc">Smith</span>,
<span class="sc">Green</span>, <span class="sc">Roberts</span>&mdash;all equally ignorant. At last we
tried the Porter. What! hadn't we heard the news? News? No! What
news? The Porter's face grew long. Why, Mr. <span class="sc">Briggs</span>, 'e
weren't comin' up no more. Not coming up? Not coming up? Nonsense!
Impossible!&mdash;Fact, gentlemen, fact. The Master,'e'd 'ad a note from Mr.
<span class="sc">Briggs</span>, sayin' as 'ow 'e wouldn't be back agin. No one knew
nothink more than that. No one could explain it.</p>

<p>There was despair in Balliol. What would become of us? Without
<span class="sc">Briggs</span> we could never catch B. N. C. Magdalen would bump
us to a certainty, and we could hardly hope to escape the House.
In football it would be just as bad. Keble and Exeter would simply
jump on us, and not a single Balliol man would have his blue. The
position was appalling; ruin stared us in the face; the College was in
consternation, for <span class="sc">Briggs</span> had disappeared.</p>

<p class="ph4">MR. BRIEFLESS, JUN., ON THE LONG VACATION.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was prevented, by an appointment of a semi-professional
character&mdash;I had been desired by a maiden aunt to give her my advice
upon a question, of damage arising out of a canine assault committed
by her lap-dog&mdash;from being present at the General Meeting of the Bar,
and consequently was unable to take part in the annual deliberations of
my learned and friendly colleagues. From what passed on the occasion
to which I refer, I gather that there was an inclination to call the
Benchers of the Inns of Court to account. It seems to me&mdash;and I believe
that I am right in the opinion&mdash;that, so long as our Masters worthily
represent the dignity of the profession, we Members of the Inner and
Outer Bar have no tangible cause for complaint.</p>

<p>But I fancy the leading subject at the Forensic Congress was the Long
Vacation. Judging from the numerous letters that have reached me
from both branches of the profession, this is a matter of the first
importance to all of us. I have been asked by many of my learned and
friendly colleagues, and my nearly equally learned and even more
friendly clients, to give my opinion on the subject. One respected
correspondent who hails from Ely Place, writes, "How could you possibly
recover from the wear and tear of your arduous practice in Trinity
Term, had you not a part of August and nearly the whole of September
and October ready to hand for recuperation?" I quite agree with Sir
<span class="sc">George</span>&mdash;I should say, my respected correspondent&mdash;that as I
near "the long," I do feel the need of rest&mdash;nay, even considerable
rest. Then a learned friend who represents not only the Bar, but
chivalry in its forensic form, sends me a caricature of "<span class="sc">Dicky
W.</span>" that would suggest that were the holidays to be decreased,
a wearer of a most distinguished order, and an athlete of no small
fame would be reduced to a condition of complete collapse. Once again,
an ornament to our Bench&mdash;perhaps the greatest ornament&mdash;honours me
with the suggestion that were we to lose a month of recreation, it
might sadden the terraces of Monte Carlo, and eclipse the merriment of
Newmarket Heath. It is needless to state that all these communications
have had weight with me. Still, I have deemed it desirable to approach
the subject with an open mind. It seems to me (and no doubt to many
others) that the question narrows itself into a matter of finance. I
have therefore taken <span class="sc">Portington</span> into my counsels, and examined
with unusual care the pages of my Fee Book. After much consultation
with my admirable and excellent clerk, and an exhaustive audit of
the figures of my forensic <i>honoraria</i>, I have come to the matured
conclusion that the lengthening or the shortening of the Long Vacation
does not affect me financially in the very least.</p>

<p class="ph3">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</p>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 1.</i>&mdash;Presto! Quick transformation scene
effected to-day. Conservatives to the right; Liberals to the left.
Stupendous, far-reaching change; one of those rarely happy events that
please everyone. Hearing what people say, it is difficult to decide
which the more pleased, Liberals at being turned out, or Conservatives
at springing in. On Ministerial side happiness marred in individual
cases by being left out of the Ministry.</p>

<p>"I'm getting up in years now, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said <span class="sc">The
Markiss</span>, "and I've had pretty long experience in making up
Ministries. But I assure you I've been staggered during last week,
including in special degree the last hour. The more offices assigned,
the narrower becomes the basis of operation, and the more desperate
the rush of the attacking party. You'd be surprised if you saw the
list of men who have asked me for something. As a rule they don't put
it in that general way. They know precisely what they want, and are
not bashful in giving it a name, though they usually end up by saying
that if this particular post is disposed of, anything else will do.
In fact, like the cabman and the coy fare, they leave it to me. I am,
as you know, of placid temperament, inclined to take genial views of
my fellow-man. But I declare, if the process of forming a Ministry
under my direction were extended beyond a fortnight, I should become a
confirmed cynic."</p>

above all things to meet their constituents. Grudge every hour that

during progress of contest inevitable. Just as well not to anticipate.

<p>"<span class="sc">Joseph</span>," he said, folding his arms in historic fashion,
letting his massive chin rest on his manly chest, what time his noble
brow shone with the radiance of mighty thoughts, "<span class="sc">Joseph</span>
will never forget his early friend and ally. It's not as if at the
last General Election I stood under his flag, won a seat, and laid
it at his feet. I fought North St. Pancras as a Home-Ruler, captured
it, and before new Parliament was many months old, went over to other
side, making early rift in lute of <span class="sc">Gladstone's</span> majority. Some
men in such circumstances would have gone back to their constituency
and said, 'Dear boys, there's a mistake somewhere. You elected me on
a particular understanding. Since then I have taken another view of
the situation and of my duty. So I come back, return the trust you
placed in my hand, and give you opportunity of electing me again, or
choosing another man.' That might have led to inconvenience. Wouldn't
run any risk; so kept my seat, and voted steadily with <span class="sc">Joseph</span>.
Suppose they won't put me in the Cabinet right off? But I shall have
choice of first-class Under-Secretaryship. Shall it be War, Navy, or
Home Department? Any one excellent; but obviously I must go to the War
Office. Don't know whether there's any particular uniform for Financial
Secretary. If not, could soon knock one up from old portrait of the
Emperor."</p>



<p>Day after day <span class="sc">Boltonparty</span> stayed at home, expecting every
hour to be sent for. Nothing came till Wednesday morning's papers
arrived, with, the news that son <span class="sc">Austen</span> was Secretary to
the Admiralty, <span class="sc">Jesse Collings</span> was installed at the Home
Office, and <span class="sc">Powell Williams</span>&mdash;who never set a squadron
in the field, and didn't in any respect resemble the Emperor
<span class="sc">Napoleon</span>&mdash;was Financial Secretary to the War Office! "That's
bad enough, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said <span class="sc">Boltonparty</span>, filing away an
iron tear that coursed down his steel-grey cheek. "But there's worse
behind. What do you think <span class="sc">Joseph</span> did when he heard I wasn't
all together pleased? He offered me a statue! Said he'd no doubt
<span class="sc">Akers-Douglas</span> could pick up on reasonable terms an old statue
of <span class="sc">Napoleon</span>; with a little touching up it would serve, and
there was a place ready on the site proposed for <span class="sc">Cromwell's</span>.
There was, he said, well-known picture of <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> Crossing
the Alps. Why shouldn't there be a statue of <span class="sc">Boltonparty</span>
Crossing Marylebone Road, North Pancras? This is man's gratitude! I've
been cruelly Elba'd on one side, and nothing remains for me now but St.
